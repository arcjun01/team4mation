## Project Description

Team4mation is a free team formation tool designed for instructors and students. The goal of the project is to help instructors create fair and balanced student teams based on factors such as GPA, schedule availability, skills, and commitment level. Students complete a short survey, and the system automatically forms teams that work well together. Team4mation is inspired by CATME but focuses on being simple, accessible, and free to use for educational purposes.
